Example of customization of navigation and security in an OpenXava project.

OpenXava does not include a complete security and navigation system, although you can easily add security and navigation in an OpenXava application if you use a Java portal, such as Liferay. Also, you can use the official solution that OpenXava team offers: XavaPro. Even though these solutions may be valid for new projects, for legacy projects you may need apply other ones.

This example shows how to customize navigation and security in an OpenXava project. You can get more information at http://www.lostinsoftware.com/2015/08/customizing-navigation-and-security-in-openxava/
